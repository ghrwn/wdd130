    <p>The Jeepney is a popular mode of public transportation in the Philippines, known for its vibrant, colorful design and distinctive shape. Originally made from surplus military jeeps left by the Americans after World War II, Jeepneys were repurposed and customized to accommodate more passengers. They typically feature wide, bench-like seating along the sides, and are a symbol of Filipino ingenuity and culture. Jeepneys are commonly used for short to medium-distance travel, operating in both urban and rural areas, and are recognized for their unique and eye-catching artwork. Despite facing modernization challenges, they remain an iconic part of Filipino transportation.</p>
